# Setup
In the deliveries folder there are two multi-platform jar files, one to set the Server up and the other one to start the Client.

### Server
The Server can be run with the following command:

```
> java -jar Server.jar 
```

This command can be followed by the following argument:

`-port`: followed by the desired port number between MIN_PORT and MAX_PORT as argument;
(for example: `-port 1234`). If you run it without the port, it will ask you the port.

|   MIN_PORT  | MAX_PORT |
|:--------:|:--------:|
|  1024 | 65535 |


### Client
The Client can be run with the following command:

```
> java -jar Client.jar 
```

This command can be followed by the following argument:

`-cli`: this command sets the Client on Command Line Interface (CLI) mode.\
`-gui`: this command sets the Client on Graphical User Interface (GUI) mode.\
`-default`: to connect to the server using the server port and the IP address saved in the [ClientConnection.json](https://github.com/fillics/ingswAM2021-calio-bartolozzi-caleffi/blob/master/src/main/resources/json/ClientConnection.json) file

If you run, for example without `-default`, the command `java -jar Client.jar -cli`, it will ask you the server port and the ip address.\
If you run the commands without any arguments, it will also ask you which view interface you want to use.

For the best user experience, it is suggested to use WSL2 (in full screen) to run the Client (CLI) and the server, with the above commands. 
To run the GUI you could also run it from the Windows' Command Prompt.
To not have problems with it and to see it correctly, you have to set the Windows setting "Change the dimension app" with the number 100%.
