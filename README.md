# Setup
In the deliveries folder there are two multi-platform jar files, one to set the Server up and the other one to start the Client.

The Server can be run with the following command:

> java -jar MORServer.jar 

This command can be followed by the following argument:

-port: followed by the desired port number between MIN_PORT and MAX_PORT as argument;
(for example: -port 1234). If you run it without the port, it will ask you the port

The Client can be run with the following command:

> java -jar MORClient.jar 

This command can be followed by the following argument:

-cli: this command sets the Client on Command Line Interface (CLI) mode.\
-gui: this command sets the Client on Graphical User Interface (GUI) mode.\
-default: to connect to the server using the server port and the IP address saved in the ClientConnection.json file

The IP address and the port to connect to can be specified during the execution.

| Multiple games    | :heavy_check_mark:     |   
| Resilience to Disconnections | :heavy_check_mark:      |    


## Build
Use maven to build jar files for both the Client and the Server by choosing the appropriate Maven Profile.


To build the Server, issue:
> mvn clean
> mvn package -P Server

To build the Client, issue:
> mvn clean
> mvn package -P Client

After these processes both jars can be found in the builds folder.
